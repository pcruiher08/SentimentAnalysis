Who's Just here To Read The Comments
LMAO vaccine! Therapeutic and cure. The way he said it is so weird lol.
The AIDS vaccine? EBOLA vaccine? Someone is confused here.
He’s reading like if I wrote that speech in 7 th grade
near 4 years and this guy still doesnt know how to speak like an adult
He managed to say nothing in 2 minutes.
“Even without it, it goes away” he said that back in February and yet here we are
"Even without the vaccine, it goes away." Why not the doctors just do themselves a favour and stop working on the vaccine, and wait to see if it goes away
This guys clearly doesn't have a single clue about what he's talking about I feel dumber just hearing him speak.

Edit: ok there's a full blown fight in the comment section rn
God it hurts just to listen to how clueless he sounds.
In other words: THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING ON
So he stated that it just 'goes away' which was a claim he made before, and it's literally ONLY continued to get worse since.

He said there would be a vaccine, which is at least hoped-for, and for which there is at least a worldwide effort, but NONE are in effectiveness testing and after that we have to get production straightened out and distribution.
It’s officially to a point where Republicans can’t defend this man.
why does it look like his hair wants to play but is scared 
0:29 AIDS doesn't have a vaccine. The hell does he smoke ?
When you lie so much it’s just hard to get your lie clear. He’s talking to someone the question is W.H.O.?
When you’re giving your class presentation that has to be 2 minutes but you only wrote a 30 second long script so you start rambling
I'm not trusting him, if they're a vaccine then he going to be the first one to try it.
i have brain damage and i still think my IQ is higher than this guy.
yeah but whenever someone gets close to finding one or speaks the "truth" they turn up fired or missing.....
Please stop letting him speak. Clearly he doesn't know what he is talking about. He keeps going in circles.
Still can't believe this guy is the president of the United States 
How does this man say so much while saying so little
Dear lord this man boy is so clueless  he's in fantasy land...
"They have come up with things" when describing scientists and doctors working on the world's most focused study. What in the actual F!
I swear to god, the next thing he's going to suggest is that we nuke covid-19
How was he dealing with these people from his bunker he’s been hiding in?
I mean...you can all hear this right? He is saying this to the whole world, yeah? He is obviously a moron, right?
They’ve come up with things...
...The therapeutic for AIDS 

WTH?
Is he slow, like genuinely...
